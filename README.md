# Final-Project---CSCI2300


The Alpha version of our project provides the baseline functionality for the pet matching game.
It includes the model that defines game behavior, a fully interactive GUI, and a controller to connect these aspects.
It provides a timer, allows the user to check for matches using mouse clicks, and accurately determines matches.
It has a working win condition if all matches are found within the time limit.
Certain features described in the Project Requirements Document will be implemented in the beta version, such as the save state and difficulty settings.
