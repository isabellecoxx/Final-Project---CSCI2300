# Final-Project---CSCI2300


The Beta version of our project provides the complete functionality for the pet matching game.
It includes the model that defines game behavior, a fully interactive GUI, and a controller to connect these aspects.
It provides a timer, allows the user to check for matches using mouse clicks, and accurately determines matches.
It has a working win condition if all matches are found within the time limit.
In addition to what was provided in the Alpha version, there is now a functional save state, difficulty settings, and sound effects when a card is flipped/match made.
